# RSA Challenges

1. **Key Generation**  
   Extend your RSA implementation to support 2048-bit keys.
   - Prompt: "Write Python code to generate 2048-bit RSA keys."

2. **Digital Signature**  
   Implement signing and verification.
   - Prompt: "Extend RSA code to include digital signature using SHA256."

3. **Hybrid Encryption**  
   Use RSA to exchange an AES session key, then encrypt a file with AES.
   - Prompt: "Write Python code for hybrid encryption with RSA and AES."

4. **Performance Test**  
   Measure encryption/decryption time for 512, 1024, 2048-bit keys.
   - Prompt: "Benchmark RSA performance with timeit."
