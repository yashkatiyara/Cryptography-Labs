# Hashing Challenges & Innovation Prompts

### Beginner
- Compute hashes of different strings and files.
- Compare MD5, SHA1, SHA256 outputs.

### Intermediate
- Build a password checker storing only hashed passwords.
- Verify file integrity using SHA256 hash.

### Advanced
- Compare hash performance on large files (benchmark MD5 vs SHA256).  
- Combine hashing with RSA to create digital signature system.
