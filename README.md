# Cryptography Labs with GitHub Copilot

Welcome to the **Cryptography Learning Repo** 🎓.  
This repo contains labs and challenges for **RSA**, **Playfair Cipher**, and **Hash Functions**.

Each folder has:
- `*_notes.md`: Theory + explanations.
- `*_basic.py`: Starter code (partially complete).
- `challenges.md`: Prompts to innovate using GitHub Copilot.

---

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Clone this repo.
2. Open in VS Code with **GitHub Copilot enabled**.
3. Read the `*_notes.md` file.
4. Complete the starter code with Copilot.
5. Attempt the **innovation challenges**.

## 🔑 Modules

### RSA (Public Key Cryptography)
- Learn key generation, encryption, decryption.
- Extend to digital signatures.
- 🧑‍💻 Project idea: Build a secure messaging app (RSA + AES).

### Playfair Cipher (Classical Cipher)
- Learn substitution rules.
- Extend to Unicode characters or images.
- 🧑‍💻 Project idea: Create a GUI Playfair Cipher Encoder/Decoder.

### Hash Functions
- Learn MD5, SHA1, SHA256, HMAC.
- Test file integrity.
- 🧑‍💻 Project idea: Build a file integrity checker tool.
